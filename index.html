       <section class="about">
         <p>
           As a Computer Science major, I’m motivated by the opportunity to apply technology in ways that empower nonprofits and drive meaningful change.
         </p>
         <p>
           In high school, I served as a <strong>STEM Project Coordinator</strong> at a local
           elementary school, where I designed and led hands-on activities to spark curiosity
           in science and math. Watching students light up when experiments clicked showed me how
           powerful early, accessible STEM experiences can be.
         </p>
         <p>
           Now at Georgia Tech, I’m continuing to combine my technical skills with community
           impact—through outreach, leadership, and projects that make technology more inclusive.
           My goal is to use what I learn in CS to <em>inspire and empower</em> the next generation
           of learners.
